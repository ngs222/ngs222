## About Me

Hello readers, my name is Noah Sutherland and I am currently a senior student in Lehigh University's Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) honors program. I am receiving a dual degree with a B.S. Computer Science Engineering (CSE) and a B.S. IBE with a concentration in Financial Mathematics. While at Lehigh, I have had the opportunity to play Division 1 soccer for the Lehigh men's soccer team, while being involved in a multitude of clubs including the Finance Club, IBE Council Committee, and LABC among others. As for my future, I have been accepted to UCLA's Master of Financial Engineering (MFE) program, and will be starting there in September of 2022.

_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify risks](midterm/analysis_report.md)**_

Above is a link to an extremely interesting project I was tasked with in my FIN377 course. The project included downloading 10-K filings from all S&P500 firms and then identifying three different categories of risk (5 total risk factors) by identifying keywords through natural language processing (in this case environmental, political, and negative-word risk). Next we downloaded the weekly returns from March 9-13, 2020 for each of these firms and then compared them to the total count of the keywords that were part of the identified risk factors above, to try and determine if there was a correlation between the risks identified and the returns during this time. The above file includes the analysis done on this project, while there are different files that run the risk factors and download the 10-K filings.

## Career Objectives

My current professional experiences include being a bank teller, a commodities trading intern, and an options trading intern. While I have loved all of my current experiences in trading, I am also interested in experiencing other fields of finance including fintech, hedge funds, PE, and consulting. I love the steep learning curve and competitive environment that trading offers, however I also would like to add to that the opportunity to interact with people. With the opportunity for two more Summers of internships with my current graduate school plans, I am excited to experience these different fields while making a difference at whatever firm I end up working for.

## Hobbies

I am originally from Richmond, VA and so my favorite sports team is the VCU men's basketball team as my father is a professor at VCU. I grew up going to games with him and they have always been who I have rooted for the hardest. I also enjoy playing piano or coding with my friends in my free time, and I am extremely into weightlifting. I enjoy travelling and my favorite place I've been to this day is Greece.
